  caveats <<~EOS
    Copy is signed and notarized, so it opens without a Gatekeeper prompt.

    It needs Accessibility access to paste into other apps for you. On first
    launch it walks you through the grant, or enable it any time under:

      System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility

    Summon the shelf with Shift-Command-V.
